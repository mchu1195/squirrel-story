My Story
By: Aaron and the Students of 98-174 F17

Chapter 1
---------
Once upon a time, a squirrel named Nibbles lived alone in a vast forest.
Every day, Nibbles would leave the safety of his home in the big oak tree
to search for acorns to save up for the long, cold winter.
One brisk October day, Nibbles was returning home with his cheeks full of
acorns. As he peeped into the entrance to his burrow, he gasped in surprise
at what he saw.

Chapter 2
---------
Someone stole all his acorns! Nibbles ended up starving during the cold winter
and died.

The End
